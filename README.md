# NeuroAssist

A free, full-stack web app to help Alzheimer's patients with personalized MCQ quizzes and reminders. Built with React + Vite + TypeScript (frontend) and Spring Boot (backend) with H2 database.

## Features
- Login/register (JWT)
- Role select: Patient or Family Member
- Family dashboard: Live location stream (SSE) + memory data entry
- Patient dashboard: Random fact from memory data, Quiz launcher, Reminders CRUD
- MCQ generation: free fallback using stored memory data; optional OpenAI via API key

## Tech stack (free)
- Frontend: React, Vite, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, React Router, Zustand, Axios, Leaflet
- Backend: Spring Boot (Web, Security, Validation, Data JPA), H2 DB, JWT (jjwt), SSE

## Setup

### 1) Backend
Java 17+ is required. Maven is needed to build (or your IDEâ€™s built-in Maven).

- Configure env in `backend/src/main/resources/application.yml` if needed. For optional OpenAI:
  - `app.openai.apiKey: "sk-..."` (leave empty to use free fallback)
- Run from IDE: run `com.neuroassist.NeuroAssistApplication`
- Or via Maven CLI:
  - `mvn -f backend/pom.xml spring-boot:run`

Backend runs at `http://localhost:8080` with H2 console at `/h2-console`.

### 2) Frontend

- Install dependencies:
  - `npm --prefix frontend install`
- Start dev server (with API proxy to 8080):
  - `npm --prefix frontend run dev`
- Build:
  - `npm --prefix frontend run build`

Dev server runs at `http://localhost:5173`.

## API quick notes
- Auth: `POST /api/auth/register|login` with `{ email, password }` returns `{ token }`.
- Subsequent requests require `Authorization: Bearer <token>`.
- SSE for live location: connect to `/api/location/stream?token=<jwt>`.

## Pages
- `/` login
- `/role` role chooser
- `/family` family dashboard
- `/patient` patient dashboard
- `/quiz` MCQ quiz

## MCQ generation
By default, quizzes are generated by recombining stored memory data into plausible options. If you set `app.openai.apiKey`, you can extend `McqService` to call OpenAI; otherwise it uses the free fallback.

## Notes
- All services and libraries used here are free/open-source.
- H2 persists to `./data/neuroassist` under backend working directory.
